# General Framework to tackle system design
4 step framework
## Understand the problem and establish design scope
* Problem presented would usually be vague, therefore we should ask clarifying questions to establish scope of design. Do not jump right into solutioning.
* Clarify the requirements. Who are the users and what features need to be built
* Come up with a list of top priority features to build and have the interviewer agree to it.
* Non functional requirements are important as well. Focus on scalability and performance. Other areas include security, consistency, accuracy, freshness, availability, reliability.
* might have to do some back of the envelope calculation and estimation on scale. 
## Propose high level design and get buy in 
## Design deep dive
## Wrap up / Summary


1. Functional Requirements
2. Non Functional Requirements
3. Compute QPS, size, users, db size
